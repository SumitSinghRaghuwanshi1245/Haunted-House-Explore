# Experience

Sumit - I had used all the things that i learned in the front-end part. Searching for various things really improved the research ability. Also this helped in discovering other things in css (clamp in CSS) , html, js, which i haven't used earlier. The Interesting thing was that i started watch gsap tutorials and got idea about how it works, (in my opinion it's just similar to code in CSS), Overall a great headscratching as well as Critical thinking Experience.
