# Experience

Sumit - I had used all the things that i learned in the front-end part. Searching for various things really improved the research ability. Also this helped in discovering other things in css (clamp in CSS) , html, js, which i haven't used earlier. The Interesting thing was that i started watch gsap tutorials and got idea about how it works, (in my opinion it's just similar to code in CSS), Overall a great headscratching as well as Critical thinking Experience. 

garima - I have designed and implemented two pages for Haunted House Explorer website. While learning how to implement the design using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I came across various challenges that I overcome using the help of online tutorials and threads. I majorly worked on the webisite's two section - a Blog Page and a Gallery Page. As the name suggests, the blog page lists out blog about people's paranomal experiences and the gallery page showcases the pictures of haunted houses, haunted forests and graveyards.
